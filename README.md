# Happy Thoughts

A little app that lets you both fetch from and post to an API. Previously we've only fetched data, so this was the first time we could actually impact the API ourselves from our own code. We created a Twitter-like message app using React, specifically the useEffect hook which was new this week. 

## The problem

Fetching the data from the API was no problem, what I found more difficult was actually posting data (in the form of messages and likes) to the API successfully and updating the message list and like button automatically without having the entire page update with every new addition to the API.
